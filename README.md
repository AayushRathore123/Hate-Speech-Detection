# Hate Speech Detection
Hate speech is one of the serious issues we see on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook daily. Most of the posts containing hate speech can be found in the accounts of people with political views. 

There is no legal definition of hate speech because people’s opinions cannot easily be classified as hateful or offensive.
The dataset I’m using for the hate speech detection task is downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset was originally collected from Twitter and contains the following columns: index, count, hate_speech,	offensive_language, neither, class, tweet

For example: 
1.	No Hate & Offensive: 
    - hello beautiful
    -	i help you
    -	nice play
    -	congratulation

2.	Offensive Language: 
    -	Hell yeah bro
    - shut up
    -	go away
    -	bad play


3.	Hate Speech: 
    +	i will kill you
    +	everything about your company is white trash
    +	you retarded bruh
